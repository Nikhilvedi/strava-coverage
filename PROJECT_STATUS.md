## 🧪 Test Results Summary

### ✅ Passing Tests
```
✅ Server Integration Tests (5/5)
   - Health check endpoint
   - OAuth authorization flow
   - CORS headers
   - Error handling middleware
   - Route registration

✅ Build & Quality Checks
   - Go build successful
   - Code formatting compliant
   - Static analysis clean (go vet)
```

### ⚠️ Database-Dependent Tests
```
⚠️ Skipped (Expected without DB connection)
   - Coverage calculation endpoints
   - City search functionality
   - User authentication flows
   - Database CRUD operations
```

**Note:** Database tests are designed for integration testing with actual PostgreSQL instances and are expected to be skipped in unit test environments.
